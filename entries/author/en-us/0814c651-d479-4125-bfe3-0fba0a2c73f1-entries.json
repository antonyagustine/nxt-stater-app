An important influence in Virginia Woolf's early life was the summer home the family used in St Ives, Cornwall, where she first saw the Godrevy Lighthouse, which was to become central in her novel To the Lighthouse (1927).","tags":[],"locale":"en-us","ACL":{},"uid":"bltf7ae8ee29b0d04f7","_version":1,"_in_progress":false,"publish_details":[{"environment":"blt9ea15b74f5bde7ee","locale":"en-us","time":"2024-01-16T12:29:35.945Z","user":"blt484b7e4e3d1b7f76","version":1},{"environment":"blta441f1826ee42f5f","locale":"en-us","time":"2024-01-16T12:29:35.949Z","user":"blt484b7e4e3d1b7f76","version":1},{"environment":"bltbfca82965463f6e1","locale":"en-us","time":"2024-01-16T12:29:35.952Z","user":"blt484b7e4e3d1b7f76","version":1}]},"blt75525926f69f94b0":{"title":"Maya Angelou","picture":{"uid":"blt0537ffb28560d64f","created_at":"2024-01-16T12:26:22.576Z","updated_at":"2024-01-16T12:26:22.576Z","created_by":"blt484b7e4e3d1b7f76","updated_by":"blt484b7e4e3d1b7f76","content_type":"image/jpeg","file_size":"41226","tags":[],"filename":"Maya_Angelou_Headshot.jpg","url":"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt1ede2eeff0c4fb86/blt0537ffb28560d64f/65a675ee3b660b486350ee70/Maya_Angelou_Headshot.jpg","ACL":[],"is_dir":false,"parent_uid":"blt8972f768dc4e2a0f","_version":1,"title":"Maya Angelou","description":"","publish_details":[{"environment":"blt9ea15b74f5bde7ee","locale":"en-us","time":"2024-01-16T12:26:24.045Z","user":"blt484b7e4e3d1b7f76","version":1},{"environment":"blt9ea15b74f5bde7ee","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2024-01-16T12:26:24.033Z","user":"blt484b7e4e3d1b7f76","version":1},{"environment":"blta441f1826ee42f5f","locale":"en-us","time":"2024-01-16T12:26:24.048Z","user":"blt484b7e4e3d1b7f76","version":1},{"environment":"blta441f1826ee42f5f","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2024-01-16T12:26:24.038Z","user":"blt484b7e4e3d1b7f76","version":1},{"environment":"bltbfca82965463f6e1","locale":"en-us","time":"2024-01-16T12:26:24.051Z","user":"blt484b7e4e3d1b7f76","version":1},{"environment":"bltbfca82965463f6e1","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2024-01-16T12:26:24.041Z","user":"blt484b7e4e3d1b7f76","version":1}]},"bio":"Became a poet and writer after a string of odd jobs during her young adulthood.

He referred humorously to his lack of success at mining, turning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise. His humorous story, \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\", was published in 1865, based on a story that he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp, California, where he had spent some time as a miner. The short story brought international attention and was even translated into French.
